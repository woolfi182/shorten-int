# ShortenInt

<!-- ![ShortenInt Screenshot](docs/images/shortenintscreen.png) -->

## Motivation

A lot of games such as Tap Titans and Idle Titans handle large numbers. When new game developers wants to build such games they spend their time to make researches and develop shorteners from scratch. Most of the solutions contain bugs or incorrect calculations.
To avoid time-consuming error-containing solutions there was a decision made to build a library to generalize shortener for JS/TS community.

## Why ShortenInt?

ShortenInt is a library that enables the development of games or applications with easier shortener of long integers and making basic mathematical operations. ShortenInt can help in the development of such games as clickers, builders and idles, where big numbers used as player balances.

> **Note:** This is early work in progress.

## Getting Started

Install dependency. Node v18.16+ is required. You can install from npmjs.com using `npm`.

```bash
npm install shorten-int
```

## Development

> Documentation will be updated soon

## Roadmap

- [x] **Motivation and base structure**.
      This involves game developers in using it.
